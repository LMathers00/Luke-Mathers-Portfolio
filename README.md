Hiya 
So i started this project originally by writing out the different sections of the site and what the potential complications could be.
Because i like to have a visual representation of my work i started with the html and generated the skeleton of the project by adding these sections.
Following this i aded the tex,photos and the basic button placements so that i could see it begin to transform. 
I then moved onto scss in order to start designing, again begining at the top and in a sense 'dressing' the HTML.
I then ran lightbox to test its scores to then find tweaks to make the whole thing easier to navigate
I got to a stage where it was basic but done but not finished.
At this point i began to push myself by adding some harder components such as the functiing drop down text boxes towards the end of the project aswell as the dropdown burger menu for mobile.
I did encounter a few issues along the way and have found a solution that makes it work. HOWEVER i am aware its probably not the most efficient code in general but it gets the job done.
Problems i did not have time to fix were "working nav bar links" without using javascript (WHich there is none of in this project) ...
aswell as i tried to colour the burger menu dropdown to being purple however the universal selector seemed to overide it which doesnt make sense to me. But as the site still works i did not see this as a huge isue
