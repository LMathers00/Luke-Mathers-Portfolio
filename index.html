        Hi my name is Luke Mathers and I am an aspiring software developer. I am from London and my love of computing started from an early age from playing video games with my late father. I have always been a curious person who is very observant so naturally i wanted to know how the world works and so i pushed my interests by taking all three sciences and Math at A level. <br>
    <br>Following this my love for both space and computing grew. I went on to study Astrophysics at the University of Sussex where i was introduced to coding on a higher level by using python to help solve complicated differential equations and aswell as monte carlo simulations
        At this point i realised my passion and my comfort of gaming were in very similar areas so naturally it was the next step for my career progression. <br><br> I think my goal one day is to be part of a major video game franchise in an attempt to help other people bond.</p>

            <p class="non_visible_text">As previously mentioned, gaming was and still is one of my fondest memories i have with my father before he passed. I felt it gave us a chance to 'muck around' in these fantasy worlds and to this day when gaming i think about whether he would've enjoyed the game.
                <br><br>
                Gaming became my escape when life got stressful and for that i'm ever greatful to all these talented coders whom i aspire to be like. Even to this day i still use gaming as a way to 'hang out' with riends across the world in the US and NZ despite the timezones

            <p class="non_visible_text">For someone who is very into his science and maths etc... it does seems abit weird to say but i am sports obsessed. I have been following my childhood football club since i can remeber and go to games whenever i can. If it's on, i am normally watching sport from football, rugby and hockey to even having a soft spot for curling.
                <br><br> I also try and get out to play sporty things whenever i can however that stopped when the pandemic took over so i'm still on the lookout to rejoin clubs etc
